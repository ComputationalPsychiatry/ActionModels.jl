# #Fitting and simulating

# The actionmodels.jl package can among other features fit models and simulate actions.

# As seen in the image below, the difference between fitting and simulating is essentially if we want to infer one or more parameters, or infer actions. 

# ![Image1](../images/fitting_vs_simulation.png)

# Fitting is an obvious path if you have action data from a participant, and you want to infer the parameters from which the specific actions could arise from. See using the package for how to do fit models.

# Both simulating and fitting with the actionmodels.jl package is straight forward, and will be elaborated further on in the fitting a model and simulating with an agent section.
