# Fitting and simulating

The actionmodels.jl package can among other features fit models and simulate actions.

As seen in the image below, the difference between fitting and simulating is essentially if we want to infer one or more parameters, or infer actions.

Fitting is an obvious path if you have action data from a participant, and you want to infer the parameters from which the specific actions could arise from. See [using the package](../Using_the_package/fitting_an_agent_model_to_data.md) for how to do fit models.

Both simulating and fitting with the actionmodels.jl package is straight forward, and will be elaborated further on in the [fitting a model](../Using_the_package/fitting_an_agent_model_to_data.md) and [simulating with an agent](../Using_the_package/Simulation_with_an_agent.md) section.
