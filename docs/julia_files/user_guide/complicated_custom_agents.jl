# # Complicated custom agents: using submodels and sub modules

# As an addition to an agent, you can implement a so-called submodel. 

# A subtruct is a method to extend the computational power of an agent. Instead of all update steps are present in the action model, we can add a level of updates through the submodel. 

# In a subtruct you can work with more states, define more parameters and in general fit more complex phenomena.
